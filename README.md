# Technical Details

## Architecture
The architecture was based on VIPER and strongly influenced by the SOLID principles.
- **View**: displays what it is told to by the Presenter and relays user input back to the Presenter.
- **Interactor**: contains the business logic as specified by a use case.
- **Presenter**: contains view logic for preparing content for display (as received from the Interactor) and for reacting to user inputs (by requesting new data from the Interactor).
- **Entity**: contains basic model objects used by the Interactor.
- **Routing**: contains navigation logic for describing which screens are shown in which order.
- **Builder**: Builder class used to build the complete module.
